## ‚öîÔ∏è Introduction

Welcome to **Type Guard**!

This is 'Type World', a peaceful realm built upon the strict rules of type safety. However, chaotic forces known as 'Compile Errors' and 'Runtime Errors' have recently invaded, threatening the world's stability.

You are a **Type Guard**, the last line of defense for Type World. Your mission is to inspect the code of visitors and protect the realm. Judge their code: does it adhere to the rules of Type World, or is it dangerous code that will bring chaos? Guard the gates!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Themed Coding Quizzes on TypeScript**: Solve interactive quizzes covering various syntax and concepts of TypeScript.
- **Pixel Art and Fantasy Concept**: Experience a nostalgic pixel art style combined with a fantasy world setting.
- **Stage and Round System**: Improve your skills step-by-step through a well-structured system of stages and rounds.
